University of Toronto courses timetable schedule by using CSP approach

Pretty easy using class timetable schedule created by using CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) search approach.

###How To Use?  
Run classScheduling.py to start the program, then follow the step to input the courses you want to take e.g. csc488s  
After you input all the courses, the program will generate a non-overlap timetable for you.

###Note:
Set USER = 0 in classScheduling.py for a test mode and change the courses list by yourself in around line 50.

Set DEBUG = 1 for debugging mode

Set VIS = 0 if you do not need to visualize the timetable but only the session name.
